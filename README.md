# USA_Restaurant_Sales_Analysis
US based Restaurant Sales Analysis using POWER BI.
The data was obtained by means of web scraping, i.e. data download with the use of programming code based on the website code. In this case, the "rvest" package from the R programming language was used along with the "SelectorGadet" browser add-on to facilitate work with the website.

The data was downloaded from www.restaurantbusinessonline.com on January 30, 2021 with three plants describing 3 rankings: top 250, top 100 indenents and future 50 thus creating 3 tables, where the restaurant is described by several variables in each row.

I have used Kaggle dataset [https://www.kaggle.com/michau96/restaurant-business-rankings-2020] for my analysis on 3 different CSV.. I have used Power BI Visualization tool for getting insights from the data. The Present Rest. Report will help the user to understand how the top restaurant survive in the pandemic by changing their menus and dining type . While the Independent Rest. Gave us an insight about their highest sales despite their individual outlets. The Future Rest. Derives positive outcome in year by year sales despite the pandemic and financial crises. This report will help the na√Øve restaurant owners an overview about the restaurant market in USA.
